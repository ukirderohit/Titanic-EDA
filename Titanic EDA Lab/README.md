##Titanic EDA Lab

For this lab you'll be using the titanic dataset (train.csv).   Your assignment is to create an Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic Data.   You may use R or Python to turn in your EDA.<br>


For each variable (except name), you'll need to know at least the following information:   <br>

1.  Is the variable categorical or continuous. <br>

2.  Are there missing values? <br>

3. Min, Max, Mean, and Standard Deviation of the continuous variables.<br>

4. Histograms describing the distribution of the variable.<br>

5.  EDA should be completed for these fields:  'PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked'
